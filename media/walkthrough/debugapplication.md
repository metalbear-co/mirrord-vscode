# Debug application with enabled mirroring

Run or debug your application. Target selection should appear at the top of the VS Code window (this step will be skipped if your mirrord configuration already specifies the target).

![target selection](./target_selection.png)

Choose the target you want to impersonate, or run your application in targetless mode. Your application will simply run in the context of the selected target or in general context of the cluster.
