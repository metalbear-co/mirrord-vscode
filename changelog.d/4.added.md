Extension now handles mirrord configs differently. Mirrord config used to run the process is expected to be specified in the launch configuration via environment variable `MIRRORD_CONFIG_FILE`. Use can temporarily override the config for the whole workspace via `selectActiveConfig` command. If the configuration is not specified, a default config is taken from the `.mirrord` directory.
