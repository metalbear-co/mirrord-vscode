mirrord lets developers [run local processes in the context of their cloud environment](https://mirrord.dev). It provides the benefits of running your service on a cloud environment (e.g. staging) without going through the hassle of deploying it there, and without disrupting the environment by deploying untested code. It comes as a Visual Studio Code extension, an IntelliJ plugin and a CLI tool. You can read more about what mirrord does [in our official docs](https://mirrord.dev/docs/overview/introduction/).

</p>

* The debugged process will start with mirrord, and receive the context of the impersonated pod. It will receive its environment variables and incoming traffic, will read and write files to it, and send outgoing traffic through it.

> Unless explicitly set [in the config](https://mirrord.dev/docs/reference/configuration/#root-kubeconfig), mirrord uses your machine's default kubeconfig for access to the Kubernetes API. Alternatively, use the [port mapping configuration](https://mirrord.dev/docs/reference/configuration/#feature-network-incoming-port_mapping).

> For incoming traffic, make sure your local process is listening on the same port as the remote pod.

## Configuring mirrord for VSCode

mirrord allows for rich configuration of the environment it provides. The schema for it is documented [here](https://mirrord.dev/docs/reference/configuration/). The extension supports autocomplete for `json` files, but you can also use `toml` or `yaml` format.

_Quick start: the easiest way to start configuring mirrord is to choose_ "Settings" _from the status bar menu, which will open a new `mirrord.json`._
